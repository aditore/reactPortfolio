## Usage

This application can be used to browse information about myself.</br>
A user lands on the home page with some basic tells of what they can do.</br>
</br>
When the user loads the portfolio they are presented with a page containing a header,</br>
a section for content, and a footer. When the user views the header,</br>
then they are presented with my name and navigation with titles corresponding to</br>
different sections of the portfolio. When the user views the navigation titles, then</br>
they are presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the</br>
title corresponding to the current section is highlighted. When a user clicks on a</br>
navigation title, then they are presented with the corresponding section below the navigation</br>
without the page reloading and that title is highlighted. When the user loads the portfolio</br>
the first time, then the landing page title and section are selected by default.</br>
When the user is presented with the About Me section, then the user sees a recent photo</br>
or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them. When the user is presented with</br>
the Portfolio section, then they see titled images of six of the developerâ€™s applications</br>
with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories.</br>
When the user is presented with the Contact section, then they see a contact form with</br>
fields for a name, an email address, and a message. When the users submits the</br>
form with one of the form fields missing, then they receive a notification that this</br>
field is required. When the user enters text into the email address field, then they</br>
receive a notification if they have entered an invalid email address. When the</br>
user is presented with the Resume section, then they see a link to a</br>
downloadable resume and a list of my proficiencies. When the user views the footer,</br>
then they are presented with text or icon links to my GitHub and LinkedIn</br>
profiles, and a link to send me an email.</br>
